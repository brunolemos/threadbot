# 👀 Thread Bot
Make people on Slack use threads instead of flooding the channels

---

### TODO

- [x] Show `Thread Bot is typing` whenever someone types so the person remembers to use thread
- [ ] ~Automatically `unshare` files from channels so comments don't flood the channel~ _(api doesn't allow bots do this 😕)_
- [ ] `/thread` command to remind everyone in the channel about this Thread Culture
- [ ] Thread message action on each message so anyone can make the bot reply to a person that is not using threads
